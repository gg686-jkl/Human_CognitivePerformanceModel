# Cognitive Performance Prediction: Linear Regression Model

## Description

The purpose of this model is to predict users' cognitive performance based on several factors, including hours of sleep, stress levels, diet, exercise, reaction time, and memory test scores. Cognitive performance refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of mental processes such as thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention. It encompasses the functions that enable individuals to process information and perform tasks.

The model employs Linear Regression to make these predictions. Linear regression estimates the relationship between a dependent variable (cognitive performance) and one or more explanatory variables (such as sleep, exercise, diet, etc.).

To test the final model, execute `streamlit run app.py`. You can also run it via the deployed model [here](https://cognitiveperformancemodel-dlfhuqwmhsjjna6vvzaq2w.streamlit.app).
